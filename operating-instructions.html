    <p> The kitchen commences its life after its assembly. Its good condition and functionality depend on the way it is used and maintained. Dialog kitchens are intended for domestic use and are designed to be of your service without any fault for many years. The advice we would like to give you on their operation and maintenance, are a preventive measure and your assistant in case of need. Different factors such as: water, moisture, fumes, sun, heat, cold, fats, acids, foods, drinks, cleaning detergents, abrasives, kitchen utensils, electrical appliances, human negligence, etc. may cause various defects to the kitchen, some of which may be irreparable. What does normal operation mean, according to Dialog? The primary purpose of the kitchen is to be used for cooking food. When we are overtaken by culinary euphoria and we go on a cooking adventure, let’s enjoy the fact of doing that in our much loved kitchen!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>When we finish work, let’s take care of the kitchen by drying and cleaning  
     our workplace. If we should summarize all instructions in one basic instruction, then this is it!</li>
        <li>If the kitchen is too humid and stiff, let’s air it, be it in the winter.</li>
        <li>When humidity is high over a longer period of time /typical of new flats/ houses/, let’s use an air dehumidifier /normal humidity is 45%-65% /</li>
        <li>When we notice moisture on the walls or ceiling in the room /in new houses/ flats in particular/, let’s first find out whether the problem is caused by the neighbour or by us. Secondly, let’s find out whether there is a damaged pipe or another reason. Thirdly, immediately call Dialog for disassembly of the kitchen.</li>
        <li>When we are washing at the sink, let’s do this carefully, not like in the bathroom. Do not allow any surface, edging or connection to be “swimming” in water.</li>
        <li>When we finish washing, let’s dry the worktops /including the water protector below the worktop/,
     the wall panels and the connections between them.</li>
        <li>When we sense an unpleasant smell from the sink trap, let’s pour some sink and drain cleaner /the granulated dry ones are more efficient/. If in a particular moment this does not help any more, then it is time to disassemble and clean the sink trap and its fixtures, making sure that we have placed a bucket or washing up bowl under it</li>
        <li>When we notice /at least at the beginning we need to be more vigilant/ that the sink trap is leaking or dripping, we should first turn the tap off, then we should dry everything and after that we should call a plumber or should notify Dialog of the problem. </li>
        <li>When we notice /at least at the beginning we need to be more vigilant/ that there is water coming out of the hoses of the dishwasher, the built-in washing machine or from somewhere under them, firstly, we should turn the appliance off, secondly, we should dry everything and thirdly, we should call the service engineer and Dialog.</li>
        <li>When the dishwashing program is over, we need to open the dishwasher at least after 2 hours and should dry the condensate from the board at the bottom of the appliance, as well as from the sides.</li>
        <li>When we are cooking, we need to turn the extractor hood on and open the window, the balcony door or the special flap that lets fresh air from the outside.</li>
        <li>When we are using the gas hob, let’s first put the utensil in place, then light the burner and 
     then turn the extractor hood on.</li>
        <li>When the extractor hood begins to make more noise than normal or its suction power is reduced, we should wash the metal filters with hot water, detergent and in the dishwasher.</li>
        <li>When the oven’s program is over, let’s dry the edges of the doors and the casing around the oven door if there is condensate on them.</li>
        <li>When we take off a hot pot, pan, another hot utensil or tool from the hob, we should not leave it directly on the worktop made of HPL, granite, technical stone, Corian, steel, wood or glass. We should use a board, wire grill or a cold plate instead.</li>
        <li>When we are cleaning any of the surfaces in the kitchen, we should use a slightly damp cloth and liquid soap and water solution, or a suitable furniture cleaning detergent /do not use hard objects or abrasives/.</li>
        <li>When we are drying we can use soft dry towel or soft kitchen tissue. </li>
        <li>When oil is splashed on the doors, we should clean them after we finish cooking.</li>
        <li>When some aggressive substances – acid, base, etc. – are splashed on the doors or other surfaces, we should clean them immediately using a very damp cloth /a few times/ and then dry them.</li>
        <li>When we spill any liquid /except for acid and base/ on the worktop, we should dry it when we finish cooking.</li>
        <li>When we spill an aggressive substance – acid or base on the worktop, let’s wash it immediately with a very damp cloth /several times/ and then dry it.</li>
        <li>When we spill a liquid over or soil with food the granite or technical stone worktop, let’s not forget that it is better to clean it and dry it faster. Fresh stains are removed more easily and do not leave traces.</li>
        <li>When we are cooking, a part of the vapours condensate around the extractor hood – on the edges and sides, door edging, wall panel connections. You should dry while cooking and turn the extractor on at an appropriate / or maximum level.</li>
        <li>When we are using a deep fryer, electric kettle, toaster or other similar appliances which produce a lot of vapours during their operation, let’s not place them under the upper cupboards. The best place for a hob is under the extractor hood.</li>
        <li>КWhen the stainless steel sink is soiled, there is a surface layer which is formed – patina of limescale, dust and dirt. It is removed by lavishly pouring hot water and liquid soap or washing powder, rubbing it out using a soft cloth – several times and after that using the Blanco detergent for cleaning and polishing steel sinks /do not use hard objects or abrasives/.</li>
        <li>When the water jet of the tap is not so powerful, let’s first unscrew and clean the strainer of the tap and then, let’s unscrew and clean the strainers of the stop valves in the sink cupboard.</li>
        <li>When we are cutting, let’s use a chopping board.</li>
        <li>When a mechanism or a drawer starts making a strange noise, it is most probably overloaded or the load is concentrated only in one part of it. Remove a few objects and distribute the rest evenly in the basket or drawer.
          <ul>
            <li>Drawing out mechanism  -  body width 150, 200 mm/ height 720 mm – payload capacity 12.5 kg – 6.25 per basket.</li>
            <li>Drawing out mechanism  -  body width 150, 200 mm/ height 720 mm – payload capacity 12.5 kg – 6.25 per basket.</li>
            <li>Drawing out mechanism  -  body width 300, 400 mm/ height 1200 mm – payload capacity 50 kg – 12.5 per basket.</li>
            <li>Drawing out mechanism  -  body width 300, 400 mm/ height 2000 mm – payload capacity 80 kg – 13.3 per basket.</li>
            <li>Corner mechanism “Magic Corner” – payload capacity 40 kg – 10 kg per basket.</li>
            <li>Metabox drawer – payload capacity 15 kg</li>
            <li>Tandembox drawer 35 kg leading mechanism, payload capacity 20 kg.</li>
            <li>Tandembox drawer 50 kg leading mechanism, payload capacity 35 kg.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>When you notice that the internal shelves are bent /downwards/, you may turn them at 180 degrees /bottom up/. This is not compulsory because they cannot fall despite the bending. The suspension of the upper modules has load-bearing capacity of 130 kg /a module with dimensions 720х900х320 and 2 middle shelves weighs approximately 25-30 kg. Bearing in mind the safety factor, the payload of a shelf is reduced to a maximum of 20 kg, for the specified size.</li>
        <li>When we remove the baseboards and corner pieces in order to clean under the kitchen units, we need to put them back on.</li>
        <li>When we want to clean the interior surfaces, the doors can be easily dismantled because Dialog kitchens have clip-on hinges /Blum/. You have to release the lower hinge first and then the top one. Clipping them back on is done in the opposite order.</li>
        <li>When we want to clean the internal surfaces of the drawers /behind them/, we can easily take the Tandem and Metabox out. We pull out, lift and take it out. Inserting it back in is done in the opposite order.</li>
        <li>When the kitchen is made from materials in dark colours and polished surfaces, let’s not
      forget that any scratches and stains are more visible.</li>
        <li>When we are cleaning and we have climbed on the worktop, we should not stand in the middle of the narrow strip of the hob and the kitchen, as well as on the hob and sink themselves.</li>
        <li>When you want to clean the casing /laminated particle board/, use a soft damp cloth, liquid soap and water solution, washing powder or glass-cleaning substance. Do not rub over the edges too much. In case of stubborn stains /glue, felt tip pens, nail polish, etc./ you can use "Elil" 10D cleaner of Dialog kitchens.</li>
        <li>When you are washing the floor and you have particle board, HPL or MDF sides standing on the floor, do not use too much water, if possible clean round them, clean manually and dry the place.</li>
        <li>If you want to turn the LED lighting with wet hands, you can do this without worrying at all. The LED lighting of Dialog kitchens is absolutely safe, has a sensor and operates at 12V.</li>
        <li>If you have to pour hot water in a steel or Silgranit sink, do not do this directly. Have the cold water running, place a suitable utensil under and slowly pour the hot water inside it.</li>
        <li>When you store various cleaning /bleaching/ substances in the cupboard under the sink, keep them tightly closed. The fumes of the more aggressive ones cause corrosion of the stop valves, penetrate the metal stitch of the flexible connections which may lead to bursting and flooding.</li>
        <li>When the silicon water protector /Dialog uses CEREZIT/ between the worktop and the wall panel becomes mouldy /dark/, call Dialog to have a new one applied.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It is impossible to describe all situations which may occur in a kitchen. If you cannot find the correct answer, are unsure or do not know how to handle a particular problem, just call Dialog.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Light soiling can be cleaned using a dry or damp soft cloth, sponge or kitchen tissue.</li>
      <li>Normal soiling – coffee, wine, oil, etc. stains are cleaned with soft wet
    loth and a solution of liquid soap in water, washing detergent or washing-up liquid.</li>
      <li>Severe soiling – dry stains of glue, water or other paint, felt tip pens, toner, etc. are cleaned using a harder wet textile towel, and washing powder and water solution, organic solvent, spirit or "Еlil" 10D cleaner of Dialog kitchens.</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="alertbox">
      <h4>Caution</h4>
      <p>Please follow the operating instructions listed above – do not place hot utensils directly on the HPL worktop, do not cut directly on it, do not allow the connections between the worktops and the sealing edges to be soaked with water, dry the water protector on the bottom side of the worktop, particularly in the area around the sink, over and at the sides of the dishwasher, do not step on the narrow strip around the hob and the sink, do not clean with abrasives. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="alertbox">
      <h4>Additional information</h4>
      <p>The HPL layer /hard brown foil under the decorative colour coat/ is 0.6-0.8 mm thick and is of exceptional hardness and impermeability. The colour of the coat will nor change significantly, even after using it for 10 years.</p>
    </div>
    <h4> Natural granite and marble worktops</h4>
    <p>The maintenance and good appearance of the natural granite and marble worktops require their periodical polishing and impregnation. The following guidelines have been made on the basis of one of the best products for maintenance of natural stone "AKEMI" – Germany. The maintenance kit includes: cleaner, impregnator for protection against stains, polisher, brush, mixing cup, sponge, polishing cloth and an additional piece of cloth.</p>

    <p>Ingredients – petroleum, heavy alkylate, propan-2-ol, n-butyl acetate. It has protective impregnating action against water and oily stains, for polished and porous stone. The impregnator is silicon-based, does not become yellow and lasts for several years. After it hardens, it is not harmful to the health. It allows the stone to breathe. With some stones, it has the effect of enhancing the colour.</p>
    <div class="alertbox">
      <h4>Method of use</h4>
      <p>The surface needs to be clean and dry. Test it on a small area in order to judge the effect and the quantity needed. It should be applied at ambient temperature of 5-25 degrees, avoid direct sunlight and moisture until the protective layer is formed. Apply evenly over the whole surface in one or several coats by means of a brush, roll, cloth which does not leave fibre residues, depending on the absorbing capacity of the stone. After about 30 minutes after the last coat, absorb the liquid which has not dried using a piece of cloth. Use chamois for polished surfaces. The impregnator will be effective after about two days, full hardening is achieved after a week.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="alertbox">
      <h4>Caution</h4>
      <p>Easily flammable. Avoid contact with the skin and eyes. Keep away from the reach of children. Do not swallow or inhale. In case of contact with the eyes or skin, flush with plenty of water. The substance is not suitable for impermeable surfaces, gypsum, plasters, varnished surfaces and surfaces sensitive to solvents, as well as plants.

    </div>
    <div class="alertbox">
      <h4>Caution</h4>
      <p>Do not inhale or swallow! Keep away from the reach of children!</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Quarella worktop made of technical stone, with polished surface</h4>
    <p>The maintenance of kitchen worktops with polished surface does not require protective treatment. For good shine, it is recommended periodical polishing with polishers such as Stoneplus by Fila. Cleaning is carried out using water solution of liquid soap, washing powder or washing up liquids available on the market. The acids of food products and liquids /vinegar, wine, coffee, juice/ do not influence the surface in contrast with the alkaline substances which, after aggressive and continuous rubbing on the same spot, give a mat finish to the polished surface. In order to remove stubborn stains /including rust stains/ you can use Deterdek by Fila and PS87 by Fila. First try out on an area which is not too visible or on a separate piece of material.</p>
    <div class="alertbox">
      <h4>Caution</h4>
      <p>Please follow the operating instructions listed above – do not place hot utensils directly on the technical stone worktop, do not cut directly on it, dry the connections between the worktops and the wall panels, do not step on the narrow strip around the hob and the sink, do not clean with abrasives, do not rub aggressively and continuously on the same spot.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Quarella worktop made of technical stone, with rough surface</h4>
    <p>The maintenance of kitchen worktops with treated /rough/ surface requires periodical application of a protective layer of the Stoneplus product of Fila. Rough surfaces are prone to soiling of the surface layer. Stains do not penetrate deeply, however, the rough structure makes their removing difficult. Cleaning is carried out using water solution of liquid soap, washing powder or washing up liquids available on the market. In order to remove stubborn stains /including rust stains/ you can use Deterdek by Fila and PS87 by Fila. First try out on an rea which is not too visible or on a separate piece of material.</p>
    <div class="alertbox">
      <h4>Caution</h4>
      <p>Please follow the operating instructions listed above – do not place hot utensils directly on the technical stone worktop, do not cut directly on it, dry the connections between the worktops and the wall panels, do not step on the narrow strip around the hob and the sink, do not clean with abrasives.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Solid wood doors</h4>
    <p>The care for the solid doors of Dialog kitchens consists of ensuring a normal climate in the kitchen and in case you want to keep the good aesthetic appearance – polishing once a year using a polisher for solid wood furniture /e.g. Pronto/.
     The finish of the doors is satin and mat. Manual polishing with a high-quality product improves the shine and protects the coat. Before use, read the instructions, try the product on an area which is not too visible, do not press or rub too hard. Use soft cotton /clean/ towel. You have to clean the doors before polishing them. Suitable are the products intended for cleaning and degreasing of glass, very diluted /with water/ alcohol-based products, as well as a slightly damp cloth with very diluted liquid soap. Movements should follow the fladder direction. Thus you will ensure in-depth cleaning even of the slightest pores. Dry if needed</p>
    <div class="alertbox">
      <h4>Caution</h4>
      <p>Do not use hard /rough/ textile, sponge or abrasive. Unsuitable cleaners are those containing acetone, ammonia and compounds, chlorine, acid. Elil 10D of Dialog kitchens is also not recommended. Excessive and prolonged humidity in new houses, exposure to high temperatures and sunlight lead to deformations and damage to the solid wood doors. When the operating instructions for the kitchen are not followed, along the edges of the doors adjoining the oven and the dishwasher will occur scaling of the varnish. The appearance of scratch marks due to the use of the kitchen is normal.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="alertbox">
      <h4>Additional information</h4>
      <p>Solid wood is a natural, live material. It is good to know and respect its properties. Prior to manufacturing of the doors, the timber is subjected to a sequence of drying processes in order to achieve a certain moisture level. The most important issue in the whole manufacturing process of doors is that the moisture level which has been achieved should not change /increase/ up to and during the final treatment – varnishing. After this treatment the doors, fronts and accessories of solid wood can withstand a temperature from 5 to 35 degrees and humidity from 50 to 70% – typical values for home conditions. The solid doors of the Dialog kitchens are made of oak, ash-tree and cherry. They have processed pores, exceptionally beautiful finish and guaranteed quality of the coat. In a dry state, oak timber has very high density – an average of 750 kg/m3, Brinell hardness – an average of 3.5; ash-tree 700 kg/m3, Brinell hardness – an average of 3.9; cherry 600 kg/m3, Brinell hardness – an average of 3.1. The good properties as to hardness, sturdiness, longevity, impermeability and the beautiful texture make them a material which is irreplaceable for manufacturers and preferred by connoisseurs.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Doors with polyurethane varnish – polish</h4>
    <p>There are no special requirements about doors with varnish coat. Varnished doors are easy to clean because the coat is smooth, relatively hard and continuous, i.e. without any interruptions between surfaces, edges, corners. The finish is 100% polish, with mirror effect and its impermeability is close to zero /applies to intact, unimpaired coat/. Soling is removed using water solution of liquid soap, washing up liquid, washing powder or products for cleaning and degreasing of glass. Use a soft cotton towel.</p>
    <div class="alertbox">
      <h4>Caution</h4>
      <p>Do not use hard /rough/ textile, sponge or abrasive. Unsuitable cleaners are those containing acetone, ammonia and compounds, chlorine, acid. Elil 10D of Dialog kitchens is also not recommended.
     Do not expose to direct sunlight and high temperature. If the varnish coat is intact, the increased and continuous humidity of the room will not affect the doors.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="alertbox">
      <h4>Additional information</h4>
      <p>For the varnished doors of Dialog kitchens we have used polyurethane varnish with UW protection. The colour of the coat will change insignificantly over the years. The appearance of traces of scratching and the decreased polish shine as result of the use of the kitchen are normal. By machine or manual polishing, the shine of the coat will be restored and the scratches will disappear. Polishing pastes are used for this purpose. It is recommended to be carried out in the factory.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Doors of laminated particle board and ABS edging</h4>
    <p>There are no special requirements for the maintenance of these doors. They should not be polished or impregnated. They have smooth and rough structure which is cleaned in the same way. Soling is removed using water solution of liquid soap, washing up liquid, washing powder or products for cleaning and degreasing of glass. Use a soft cotton towel. 
     Always dry. In case of stubborn stains you can use Elil 10D of Dialog kitchens.</p>
    <div class="alertbox">
      <h4>Caution</h4>
      <p>Do not use hard /rough/ textile, sponge or abrasive. Unsuitable cleaners are those containing acetone, ammonia and compounds, chlorine, acid. Do not rub the edges and corners too hard. Do not expose to direct sunlight and high temperature. Increased and continuous humidity in new houses, continuous hot evaporations from the oven, dishwasher and other appliances may lead to unsticking of the edging, deformation of the particle board and change in the colour of the laminate. The appearance of traces of scratching as result of the use of the kitchen are normal. The surface appearance cannot be restored.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="alertbox">
      <h4>Additional information</h4>
      <p>The thickness of the laminate /in gr/m2/ is an important quality indicator and varies for each producer of particle boards. So is the materials used in the particle boards. The rough coat and wood décor is harder as compared to the smooth structure and monochrome colour. The resistance to wear and tear, as compared to the HPL worktops and wall panels, is smaller and that is why the material is used mainly for doors and casings. The ABS edging /acrylbutadienstyrol/ is harder than the PVC edging /polyvinylchloride/. The weak spot of the laminated particle board doors is their edges, in the area where the plate is sealed to the edging. In factory conditions, the edging is sealed at a temperature of the glue of 200 degrees. When used at home, it is enough to be subjected to a temperature of 80 degrees for 1-2 minutes and it will come unstuck. Any liquid which falls on the particle board – edging connection will penetrate deeply and deform the material /regardless of the quality of gluing of the particles/. The colour of the coat will change insignificantly over the years.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Movable parts</h4>
    <p>The upward opening mechanisms Aventos, the drawing out, turning and corner mechanisms, the leading mechanisms of the Metabox and Tandembox drawers and the hinges do not require lubrication or any other maintenance.</p>

    <h3>Safety instructions</h3>
    <p>Turn off the switch of the electrical cabinet /pull down the fuse/ when you clean any appliance thoroughly. Turn off the switch of the electrical cabinet for the kitchen and the main switch when you leave small children in the room without supervision. Do not plug an electrical appliance with wet hands /toaster, coffee machine, mixer, etc./ Close the valve of the gas bottle /especially if it is inside the kitchen/ when you finish cooking. Do not hang on the suspended cupboards, especially on the top or bottom sides – it is nearly impossible for them to fall /tear out of the wall/ in spite of such an intervention, however, you might get hurt if some of the details break. Do not forget that when you light the gas hob without a utensil on it and if the extractor hood is working, you may start a fire.</p>
