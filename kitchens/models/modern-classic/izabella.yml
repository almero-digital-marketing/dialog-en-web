doors:
  description: 'The doors of the upper cupboards are completely opened without any interference to the nearby space. Each door is coloured and patinated in order to enhance the effect of the wood and to seal the pores of the timber thereby protecting it against the influence of the external factors, the moisture and the sun. The doors are made of solid oak, 25 mm in thickness. Fine workmanship and excellent sturdiness which will last for a long time.'
