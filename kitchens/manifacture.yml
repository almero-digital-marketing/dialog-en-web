    title: 'Casing'
    caption: 'Casing meeting the European standards of quality and environmental protection'
    description: 'The casing structure is the standard one, with load-bearing vertical sides. These are made of particle boards of 18 mm in width, made by Egger, Kaindl – Austria and Kronospan – Bulgaria (meeting the requirements of all European standards of quality and environmental protection). They have ABS edging made by Hranipex, 0.5, 1 or 2 mm thick, with the respective rounding. The eccentric Ø8 dowel pin connection ensures precision, sturdiness and aesthetic appearance. For reliable fixing of the hardware to the particle board, we use euro screw of Ø6.3 mm in diameter. We provide all hidden edgings. The monolithic structure of the kitchen casing is achieved by means of M4 nut and screw fixing elements.'

    title: 'Drawers'
    caption: 'Special system for drawers from 35 to 50 kg'
    description: 'For drawers of 35 to 50 kg (total load-bearing capacity) and 20, 35 kg (payload) we use „Tandembox“ by Blum with an integrated system for smooth closing, complete drawing out and synchronised running of unevenly distributed load. The bottom is hard, 16 mm thick. The railing system provides the option for various combinations of superstructures and divisions. The front is fixed precisely and firmly using Ø10 mm PVC dowel pin. The front can be easily disassembled thanks to a clip system which ensures easy cleaning. In Dialog kitchens you will also find the Servo drive electro-system for assisted opening. The advantages as compared to other systems are several, and the most important of them is the shared control via a single controller of the Tandembox drawers and the "Aventos" clapping mechanisms.'
